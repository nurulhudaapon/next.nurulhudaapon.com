        I've been interested in hardware since I was a kid, and I started programming late in high school back in 2019.
        However, I began my professional career early that same year. I started with JavaScript/TypeScript and mostly
        wrote automation tests in C# using Selenium. Fast forward to 2025, I still work at the same company but now as a
        Staff Engineer.

        Working full-time while studying is challenging, but it has taught me valuable time management skills and
        perseverance.

        In my free time, I mostly spend learning and exploring new technologies. I'm a conservative but friendly person
        who loves meeting new people.
