        Hi, I'm Nurul. I work as a Staff Engineer at Voyage SMS. I build software using C#, .NET Core, React, TypeScript, and PostgreSQL. I started learning to code in 2019 when I was in college, and I've loved it ever since.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-400">
        I learned to code with JavaScript. My first big project was a small banking system for kids to help them learn about saving money. I like to build real things instead of just following tutorials. This helps me learn better and solve real problems.

      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-400">
        Right now, I'm studying Computer Science at Green University of Bangladesh. I'll finish my degree in 2026. Working full-time while studying is hard, but it has taught me how to manage my time well and never give up.

      <p className="text-lg text-neutral-400">
        I started as a QA Engineer and worked my way up to Staff Engineer. I believe in learning new things every day and always trying to do my best. I love building software that helps people and makes a difference.
